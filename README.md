# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. The tool
[dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) is used to setup the dotfiles.

## Structure of the dotfiles

This repository is structured in such a way that it is easier to setup on
different systems. For this, we have file `install-profile` to install system
specific dotfiles. The different profiles are stored in `meta/profiles`.
