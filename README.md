# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles. To install the dotfiles, I utilized a
tool, called [dotfiles](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dotfiles#configuration). In addition, this repository is inspired by different repositories containing dotfiles and machine configurations found all over GitHub and the web.

## Structure of the dotfiles

This repository is structured in such a way that it is easier to setup on different systems. For this, we have file `install-profile` to install system specific dotfiles. The different profiles are stored in `meta/profiles`.
